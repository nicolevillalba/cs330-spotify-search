# Spotify Searcher

This is a webpage that allows users to search for artists, songs, and albums using the API Tutor to query Spotify. The results diplay the top artist, the top 5 songs, and the top 20 albums based on search. Users can also play a 30 second demo of the available songs. 

## Motivation

The goal of this project was to become familiar with the common uses of Jacascript in frontend web development. I dynamically manipulated the DOM, rendered HTML templates, build event handlers to respond to user events, and leverages data using the ES6 fetch API.
